# Chalets-et-Caviar
Changes that I made for an OpenClassroom Project

I had to change a few things on the theme I had choosen (Hestia) for my project so I created this child theme,
It just change the "features features" part to remove a column, move the others and offer them a nice button each.

It also change the class of the button on the main page to "btn btn-primary".
